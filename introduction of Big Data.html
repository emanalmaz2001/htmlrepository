<p>Big data is an abstract concept. Apart from masses of data, it also has some other features, which determine the difference between itself and “massive data” or “very big data.” At present, although the importance of big data has been generally recognized, people still have different opinions on its definition. In general, big data shall mean the datasets that could not be perceived, acquired, managed, and processed by traditional IT and software/hardware tools within a tolerable time. Because of different concerns, scientific and technological enterprises, research scholars, data analysts, and technical practitioners have different definitions of big data. The following definitions may help us have a better understanding on the profound social, economic, and technological connotations of big data.</p>
