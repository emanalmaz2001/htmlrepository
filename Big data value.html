<p>McKinsey & Company observed how big data created values after in-depth research on the U.S. healthcare, the EU public sector administration, the U.S. retail, the global manufacturing, and the global personal location data. Through research on the five core industries that represent the global economy, the McKinsey report pointed out that big data may give a full play to the economic function, improve the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises and public sectors, and create huge benefits for consumers. In [10], McKinsey summarized the values that big data could create: if big data could be creatively and effectively utilized to improve efficiency and quality, the potential value of the U.S medical industry gained through data may surpass USD 300 billion, thus reducing the expenditure for the U.S. healthcare by over 8 %; retailers that fully utilize big data may improve their profit by more than 60 %; big data may also be utilized to improve the efficiency of government operations, such that the developed economies in Europe could save over EUR 100 billion (which excludes the effect of reduced frauds, errors, and tax difference).</p>
